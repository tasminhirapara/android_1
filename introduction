What is software 
->Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks. It is the opposite of hardware, which describes the physical aspects of a computer. Software is a generic term used to refer to applications, scripts and programs that run on a device. It can be thought of as the variable part of a computer, while hardware is the invariable part.

 Types of application
->Some types of applications include:
Word processors.
Database programs.
Web browsers.
Deployment tools.
Image editors.
Communication platforms.

 What is mobile application
->A mobile app (or mobile application) is a software application developed specifically for use on small, wireless computing devices, such as smartphones and tablets, rather than desktop or laptop computers.

 Difference between mobile application and web application
->Mobile applications need to be installed from the app store, while web applications can be easily viewed from any browser and thus do not need to be installed. Mobile applications can be accessed even offline, and that's not the case with web applications since browsers do not work without a proper internet connection.

5) Who developed Android 
->Android is developed by a consortium of developers known as the Open Handset Alliance, though its most widely used version is primarily developed by Google.
